Knowledge representation
Tables:
    3 types of tables:
        1. nodes (pk autogen nodeId, entity name)
        2. edges (source FK nodeId, dest fk node, relationship, value)
        3. entity specific tables
            - SongsTable(song name, genre, artist fk artist, length, popularity, date, ...)
            - ArtistTable (artist name, born, died, popular time period, ...)

Queries:
    Play songs like despicito that are faster and more obscure
        1. Get all edges with (source:despicito, similarity:ANY)
        2. Find despicito in SongsTable using nodeId, get speed and popularity
        3. SELECT * from 1. WHERE speed > despicito.speed AND popularity < despicito.popularity
